                </h5>

                <p>
                  Brawijaya Law Journal : Journal of Legal Studies does not require any rigid format for conducting a book review. Reviewers should feel at liberty to approach the review in their own style with the broader aim of contextualizing the work in the literature or policy developments at the time of publication. We welcome reviews about academic books, monographs or edited volumes, policy publications, or reviews on past works that are relevant for re-engaging in theory, policy, and practice related to contemporary issues in legal scholarship.

                  <br><br>

                  The remainder of this document sets out some guidelines for potential book reviewers to follow in conducting a review. Word count: We prefer formats between 1000-1500 words. The review should also seek out to cover the questions listed below:
                </p>

                <div class="paper-book-review">
                  <ul>
                    <li>How is the author's background and work situated in the broader field of study?</li>
                    <li>
                      What is the central argument of the book and how is the work timely in its theoretical or empirical engagement? Does it deliver and does it leave anything out?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What was the methodology and factual basis of the study? Were there factual errors and oversights or faulty assumptions? We are especially interested in a close review of the sources, extent, and depth of the research.
                    </li>
                    <li>Who is the audience of the book?</li>
                    <li>How is the structure, prose, length, and other aspects of the books accessibility and readability? Is it enjoyable?</li>
                    <li>Are there unique features to the book in terms of illustrations, indexing, bibliographic or other aspects?</li>
                    <li>Does the title capture the book's major argument?</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Situate within the broader literature both theoretically and empirically. Has this book filled a key gap and how?

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Review the components of the arguments and review the strengths and weaknesses of each of the arguments. Are there key features of the book that were particularly memorable?
                    </li>
                    <li>What new questions does the book raise?</li>
                  </ul>
